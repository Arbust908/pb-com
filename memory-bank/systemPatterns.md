# System Patterns

## System Architecture

- The application is built using Nuxt 3, a framework for creating Vue.js applications.
- It follows a component-based architecture, where UI elements are organized into reusable components.
- UnoCSS is used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS.
- The application includes a chat component for user interaction.

## Key Technical Decisions

- The choice of Nuxt 3 provides a robust and well-structured framework for development.
- UnoCSS was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use in creating custom styles.
- The inclusion of a chat component enhances user engagement.

## Design Patterns

- Component-based architecture: The UI is built using reusable Vue components.
- Utility-first CSS: UnoCSS provides a set of utility classes for styling.

## Component Relationships

- Components are organized in a hierarchical structure, with parent components passing data to child components.
- The chat component likely interacts with a backend service or API for real-time communication.
