Usually, we build Complex eCommerce that need to have a pristine SEO ranking for that end I apply my knowledge to build PWA ready web apps that manage session information in Vuex states. For external data y connect to backend services via REST APIs using Axios. Depending on client demand we use an existing Component Library (like Vue-bootstrap), if not, I usually build a custom component library with the help of TailwindCSS styling. If our client doesn\'t have a design of their own I also take part in the Design phase using Adobe XD o Figma From time to time we have taken projects that did have an existing codebase in other languages or frameworks which we work on top (Laravel, React, Plain HTML + CSS + Alpine)',

As a styling library, I wrote various SASS functions with the company\'s brand\'s manual to be used in the Blade templates.  As a second version, for security and speed, we migrated all backend CMS to a Vue + Node service and served all data to the Laravel Front End via APIs. I upgraded all our Blade templates into Blade Components for reusability and maintainability. For new Components, I had to design them and get them approved, which I did with Adobe XD.  We then migrated our Blade Components to Vue components for optimization. This meant I had to teach our team Vue.  As the last version we migrated our complete Laravel Front End to Nuxt and switched our SASS library for TailwindCSS.',

Then we embarked into the backend with simple server responses with PHP and server-rendered dynamic pages. We learned SQL databases with MySQL and made PDO connections with our PHP backends.  After that I explained the Basis of OOP (Object-oriented Programming), SOLID design pattern, and ACID. After a concept-heavy unit we start building a full-stack application with Laravel as a framework. Finally we explore client dynamic pages adding Javascript to the Laravel Apps. All students were evaluated in an application they had to build on their own in the span of 1 month consisting of one or more CRUDs, a login with a user profile, and dynamic front ends.   As a plus I taught via workshops CSS Grid, animation with keyframes and SASS',
